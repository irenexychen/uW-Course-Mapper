//TODO
- scrape data
- save into something easily manipulatable
    - course, descriptions, prereq, antireq... probably mongoDB


//DATABASE FORMAT
database of courses
Collection = faculty i.e. cs
Document/Post = course

Post = {
    course_name
    course_id
    prereq
    antireq
    desc
   }

//FUTURE EXPANSIONS
- create web interface for user profiles to save course plans and login
- find out a way to integrate uwflow?? idk
